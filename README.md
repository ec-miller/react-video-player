# React Video Player

This project was created in Stephen Grider's Reace and Redux course on Udemy - interested in learning [Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)?

I added a few features:
1. New searches will not refresh the video you are viewing
2. Full screen viewing of videos enabled
2. Fkj's & Masego's live (and improvised?) song Tadow is the default video :)
